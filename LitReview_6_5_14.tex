\section{Magnetic Wood}
Authors cooked various iron solutions into the wood, and the iron formed magnetic crystals within the cell walls. It wasn't expected that the irons would pick a preferred direction, but they preferred to align along the "longitudinal" direction, i.e. up and down the trunk of the tree. The resulting magnetic wood was mostly paramagnetic, and it lined up and flipped around in response to an external field. People are now proposing to use magnetic wood as an electromagnetic absorber.

\section{Machine Learning Algorithm Repository}
Machine learning algorithms need training sets and running learning experiments with various learning algorithms. The repo will store "predictions for each test instance as well as the learning algorithm, hyper parameters, and training sets," which will help facilitate metalearning: data on learning algorithms. There already exist databases like this, but this one focuses on ease of access, direct downloadability of all sorts of data, open access, and query-ability.

\emph{Machine Learning Results Repository} (MLRR) provides data sets ready for download for meta-learning problems.

\section{Superelastic Organic Crystals}
Superelasticity is a misnomer: it should be referred to as pseudoelasticity. Upon significant stress, the crystal structure changes from one phase to another, and when the stress is relieved, the crystal assumes its original crystal phase, which gives rise to its other name: shape-memory alloys. They've always been in the context of metal alloys, but not an organic system.

Terephthalamide (benzene ring with some amines on the ends), makes two crystal phases. The $\alpha$ phase is a polymeric sheet that's repeating with one molecule per unit cell. In $\beta$ phase, the unit cell is more complex and the benzene rings are all twisted in various ways, but this is a more dense packing I guess. They got it to store elastic energy with $92.5\%$ efficiency with shears up to $11.3\%$.

\section{Self-reproducing Inorganic Colloidosomes}
Instead of lipid membranes, the membrane is an ultrathin layer of silica nano particles surrounding stable droplets of water. They first make the water droplets with Pickering emulsion, then bind the silica particles with oligomeric crosslinkings. The binding produces methanol, which doesn't like to be in the oil on the exterior, and so it diffuses into the cell, and the cell grows in size and burgeons with pressure. At a particular critical pressure, the water/methanol leaks out and buds into a new cell, which gathers around it some more silica nanoparticles until the cell totally buds and seals itself.

\section{Open Structures with Patchy Colloidal Particles}
You got some triblock Janus particles which can form, depending on their patch sizes, a few different kinds of open lattices. Open lattices exhibit things like a negative Poisson ratio, negative thermal expansion, and "holographic elasticity," meaning that information about the bulk is encoded on the surface, where the external constraints are.

They find that the bonds are stabilized by an effective bending and twisting modulus at each lattice site which comes from entropic considerations: the more ways the spheres can pivot around in their sockets, the better the bond. With no bending modulus, they have lots and lots of zero-frequency (floppy) modes, but when you include the bending modulus, you lift the floppy modes and they become rigid.

Also, look at this phase diagram. Have you seen a more MSPaint phase diagram?
