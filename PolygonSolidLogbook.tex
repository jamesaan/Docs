\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

This document is meant to log my progress in the investigation of mechanical 
modes in crystals of hard regular polygon particles. The system consists of $N 
= n^2\times n_{\mathrm{unit}}$ particles, where $n$ is some integer and 
$n_\mathrm{unit}$ is the number of particles in the unit cell. The system is 
initialized in its densest known packing and then the crystal vectors are 
enlarged by constant factors to achieve a prescribed packing fraction. The 
motion of particles is decomposed into $n\times n$ distinct Fourier modes. 
There are $3n_\mathrm{unit}$ relevant fields to investigate. The first 
$2n_\mathrm{unit}$ are phonon fields signified by $\bv{\tilde u} = 
\paren{\tilde u_x, \tilde u_y}$ (if the number of particles per unit cell is 
greater than 1, then these fields are further indexed \emph{i.e.\!} $\bv{\tilde 
u}^{\a,\b,\g\ldots}$. The remaining $n_\mathrm{unit}$ fields are libron fields, 
signified by $\tilde \th^{\a,\b,\g\ldots}$. In the case of hexagons, 
$n_\mathrm{unit} = 1$, and in the case of many other polygons including 
pentagons studied here, $n_\mathrm{unit} = 2$.

The various control parameters in a simulation are $n$ the number of unit 
cells along one side of the box, $\phi$ the packing fraction, $s$ the number of 
simulation steps, and the polygon shape. The densest packing, and thus the 
crystal lattice vectors, are determined by the polygon. The real space lattice 
vectors given by $\bv a_1, \bv a_2$ are usually meant to be in the densest 
packing, $\phi_\mathrm{max}$. When the system is relaxed to a smaller packing 
fraction, the lattice vectors are presumed to be $\bv a_i(\phi) = \bv a_i 
\sqrt{\phi_\mathrm{max}/\phi}$. The reciprocal lattice vectors $\bv G_i$ are 
constructed from these real space lattice vectors, and the unit cell of the 
reciprocal lattice forms the Brillouin zone within which $\bv k$ vectors are 
sampled. The relevant $\bv k$ vectors to sample are $n_1 \bv G_1/n + n_2 \bv 
G_2/n$, where $n_i$ are integers. This way, the same number of Fourier modes 
are sampled as there are degrees of freedom in the real space system.

The Fourier modes are analyzed by considering their correlation functions. In 
Monte Carlo, dynamical information is not available, so collective degrees of 
freedom need to be analyzed from correlation functions by way of a kind of 
generalized law of equipartition. We assume that this hard particle system 
which is controlled exclusively by entropic interactions can be approximated by 
a harmonic Hamiltonian:
\beq \mathcal{H} = \recip{2m} p_i \d_{ij} p_j + \recip{2I} 
L_i \d_{ij} L_j + \half 1 x_i K_{ij} x_j. \eeq
The first term is the translational kinetic energy and the second term is the 
rotational kinetic energy. The last term is a harmonic coupling by a $3N\times 
3N$ matrix, and $x_i$ represent both the particle positions and particle 
orientations. In thermal equilibrium, it is provable that
\beq \avg{x_i x_j} =  k_BTK_{ij}^{-1}. \leeq{gen_equipartition}
The matrix $K_{ij}$ is partially diagonalized by the Fourier transform with 
respect to the lattice vectors $\bv a_{1,2}(\phi)$, so we find that
\beq \avg{\tilde x^*_{\mu,\bv k} \tilde x_{\nu, \bv k} } = C_{\mu\nu,\bv k} 
= k_BT K_{\mu\nu,\bv k}^{-1}. \eeq
This decomposes the large $3N\times 3N$ matrix $K_{ij}$ into a block diagonal 
$n^2\times n^2$ matrix whose diagonal elements are $3n_\mathrm{unit} \times 
3n_\mathrm{unit}$ matrices $K_{\mu\nu}$. The modes $\tilde x_\mu$ can represent 
either $\bv{\tilde u}_x^{\a,\b\ldots}$, $\bv{\tilde u}_y^{\a,\b\ldots}$ or 
$\tilde \th^{\a,\b\ldots}$. The ultimate output of the analysis are the
$K_{\mu\nu,\bv k}$, which are obtained by computing every correlation 
function of all modes of the same wave vector and inverting the resulting matrix 
$C_{\mu\nu,\bv k}$. The elements of $\bv K_{\bv k}$ are the squares of the 
phonon and libron dispersion relations, \emph{i.e.\!} they furnish $\w^2(\bv 
k)$ for all $\bv k$ sampled in the Brillouin zone and for all collective modes 
$\bv {\tilde u}^{\a,\b\ldots}$ and $\tilde \th^{\a,\b\ldots}$.

The matrices $\bv K_{\bv k}$ depend on the packing 
fraction $\phi$, the number of particles $N$, and the number of Monte 
Carlo sweeps taken $s$. If $s$ is too small, then there is not a sufficient 
number of statistically independent Monte Carlo frames to compute the elements 
of the correlation matrix $\bv C$. The effect of $s$ will be explored in Section 
\ref{sec:s}.

In principle, the matrix $\bv C$ should be independent of $N$ (or equivalently 
$n$), but having larger $N$ helps resolve $\bv C$ as a function of $\bv k$, the 
wavevector, as the Brillouin zone is more densely populated. The effect of $N$ 
will be explored in Section \ref{sec:N}.

The matrix $\bv C$ is most markedly affected by changes in the packing 
fraction. Because polygon crystals melt into various phases (hexatic, 
rotator, or plain fluid), particular elements of $\bv C$ should simply vanish 
across these transitions, which I will show leads to flat dispersion relations. 
That is, particular elements of $\bv K_{\bv k}$ become independent of $\bv k$. 
The effect of packing fraction will be shown in Section \ref{sec:phi}.

One of the difficulties in discerning meaningful interpretations of $\bv K_{\bv 
k}$ is obviously the high dimensionality of the matrix. It is necessarily 
symmetric, so it has $3n_\mathrm{unit} (3n_\mathrm{unit}+1)/2$ independent 
components, each of which is a function of the two-dimensional $\bv k$. Even 
for the one-particle unit cell of the hexagon crystal, there are 6 independent 
elements of $\bv K_{\bv k}$ that need to be explored. Luckily, at quadratic 
order, the phonon mode is uncoupled from the libron mode, so this reduces the 
6 components to 4 components (this uncoupling will also be demonstrated 
explicitly in Section \ref{sec:higherorder}).

To alleviate the difficulty in plotting a large-dimensional object as a function of a two-dimensional object, I resorted to taking cross sections in the Brillouin zone and plotting each of the $3n_\mathrm{unit}(3n_\mathrm{unit}+1)/2$ elements in the same figure. A sample plot is shown in Figure \ref{sample}. These should be interpreted as giving the square frequencies of collective modes.

\caption{Sample figure for $\phi = 0.8$ (I used ``pfi" for ``packing fraction" and don't remember why I had the extra i). The curves marked with closed circles and error bars are from simulation data, and curves of the same color marked with x's are best-fit theoretical curves. The object $K_{yy}$ is the dispersion curve for a longitudinal phonon traveling in the $y$ direction (because here, the component $k_x = 0$), and $K_{xx}$ is the dispersion for a transverse phonon. Along this particular axis in the Brillouin zone, the off-diagonal component $K_{xy}$ is 0, but is displayed anyway. $K_{\th\th}$ is the dispersion for the libron, and because it is so much smaller than the phonon dispersion, we see that the libron is a more relaxed mode than the phonon. The off-diagonal elements $K_{x\th}$ and $K_{y\th}$ should also be 0 for all points in the Brillouin zone, but are also shown anyway. More plots will feature the $\th$ elements zoomed in.}

\section{Theoretical model}
\label{sec:theory}

The dispersion curves produced by the Fourier analysis described in Section \ref{sec:overview} are fitted by a harmonic lattice model. A fundamental assumption of all the models is that the free energy of the system can be broken down into a sum of pairwise potentials between polygons that are close together. The simplest model assumes that this effective interaction energy is so close range that only nearest neighbors of the lattice feel each other. Furthermore, the two-body interaction potential is assumed to be at least twice-differentiable, so a harmonic approximation can be made. With the quadratic assumption, the dispersion curves can be calculated exactly as a function of only a couple parameters which correspond to second derivatives of the two-body potential. Lattices with high symmetry like the triangular lattice of hard hexagons have only 3 free parameters (1 for the phonons and 2 for the librons). In general, the theoretical matrix $\bv K_{\bv k}$ is of the form
\beq \bv K_{\bv k} = \pmtrx{ K_{xx} & K_{xy} & K_{x\th} \\ K_{xy} & K_{yy} & K_{y\th} \\ K_{x\th} & K_{y\th} & K_{\th\th} } = \pmtrx{ 4 \g_{xx} & 4\g_{xy} & 0 \\ 4\g_{xy} & 4\g_{yy} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 4 \mu + 4 \g}. \eeq
\beq \g_{ij} = \half{1} \sum_{\bv c} A_{\bv c} \hat{c}_i\hat{c}_j \sin^2\paren{\half{\Dot{k}{c}}}, \quad \g = \half{1} \sum_{\bv c} E_{\bv c}\sin^2\paren{\half{\Dot{k}{c}}}, \quad \mu = \half{1} \sum_{\bv c} D_{\bv c}\cos^2\paren{\half{\Dot{k}{c}}}. \eeq
The off-diagonal elements used to contain parameters like $B, C,$ and $F$, but those ended up going to zero by symmetries, so I found myself in a similar boat to Maxwell, who had so many vector fields to deal with while formalizing electromagnetic theory that he just labeled them alphabetically. The constants $A_{\bv c}$, $E_{\bv c}$ and $D_{\bv c}$ depend on the vector $\bv c$ which separates two particles. In the hexagon lattice, all the nearest neighbors are the same by six-fold symmetry, so all of these parameters are independent of $\bv c$. In the pentagon lattice, the crystal only has two-fold symmetry, which brings us from 18 independent parameters to 9.

If we include next nearest neighbor interactions, then this introduces another set of constants that correspond to a second derivative of the effective interatomic pair potential, this time at a further distance. For both hexagons and pentagons, this would double the number of phenomenological constants to fit to. However, all of these constants appear as exterior multiplicative factors: the functional form of the dispersion curves are entirely predicted.

A key technical point is that for all the phonon dispersion curves, $\bv k = 0$ is a totally unaccessible mode, and is not shown in any plots. This is because the $\bv k = 0$ mode is a uniform translation. However, since the crystal can move any amount in the periodic simulation box, this mode is completely free. Because any particle motion in MC is a random event, the correlation function associated with the average position of the entire crystal will be arbitrarily small, so when it is inverted to give the phonon dispersion, the associated frequency is arbitrarily \emph{large}. This divergence is totally artificial and a result of the simulation method, which does not preserve momentum conservation.

Here is a table of the simulations that have been completed. The rows vary in $N$ and $s$, and the columns vary in $\phi$.

%%Timescale effects
\section{Small sampling effects}
\label{sec:s}

In a given simulation, $s$ is the number of Monte Carlo sweeps, and snapshots are taken at a period such that there are $10^3/2$ presumably statistically independent frames to make correlation functions from. $10^3$ frames are taken but only the latter half of them are used to compute correlation functions from, as to ensure the the simulations have equilibrated. Therefore, every sampled frame is separated a period of $T = s\times 10^{-3}$ sweeps. If this period is too small, frames won't be sufficiently independent from each other and spurious correlations will be introduced. However, if $T$ is needlessly long, simulation time is wasted. Below are some plots of the dispersion curves at various packing fractions for hexagons. Keep in mind that at around $\phi = 0.700$--$0.710$ the crystal melts into a hexatic phase. It's not unreasonable that critical slowing down may occur near this transition point, and so shorter simulations may vary from longer simulations significantly.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{N=[676]_pfi=[0.85]_steps=[3000000.0, 10000000.0, 30000000.0]_xxyythth_kx=0}.pdf}
\caption{$N=676$ and $\phi = 0.850$. For a sufficiently dense crystal, running the simulation longer than $3\E6$ sweeps doesn't change the dispersion curves at all.}
\label{steps1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{N=[676]_pfi=[0.71]_steps=[3000000.0, 10000000.0, 30000000.0]_yy_kx=0}.pdf}
\caption{$N=676$ and $\phi = 0.710$. Only the longitudinal phonon is shown for clarity. The dispersion curve changes drastically as the simulation runtime is increased. Error bars are significantly reduced, and had the simulation not been run for longer, I would have mistakenly assumed that the phonon mode had survived even down to $\phi=0.710$. Clearly, though, long-time correlations play a large role.}
\label{steps2}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{N=[676]_pfi=[0.71]_steps=[3000000.0, 10000000.0, 30000000.0]_thth_kx=0}.pdf}
\caption{$N=676$ and $\phi = 0.710$, same conditions as Figure \ref{steps2}. Though the phonon mode was very sensitive to the time sampling, the libron mode shows robustness, because this mode survives the crystal melting transition into the hexatic phase.}
\label{steps3}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{N=[676]_pfi=[0.7]_steps=[10000000.0, 30000000.0]_yy_kx=0}.pdf}
\caption{$N=676$ and $\phi = 0.700$. The phonon mode is totally extinguished at this density, as shown by the longer-time simulation. There are large error bars associated with long-wavelength modes, which is not surprising because dislocation defects pervade the system at this density, so phonons on short length scaled (large $k$-vectors) will be well resolved, but small $k$-vector phonons will not. The $s=3\E6$ simulation is not even shown because it is such garbage.}
\label{steps4}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{{N=[676]_pfi=[0.7]_steps=[3000000.0, 10000000.0, 30000000.0]_thth_kx=0}.pdf}
\caption{$N=676$ and $\phi = 0.700$. The libron mode is beginning to show large deviations as a function of simulation time at this density. We're nearing the hexatic phase transition density, which is somewhere around $0.69$}
\label{steps5}
\end{figure}

The main takeaway of Figures \ref{steps1}--\ref{steps5} is that either longer simulations need to be run or the sampling period needs to be changed as the critical point is approached. The latter is clearly the simplest method, but it reduces the number of independent frames to create correlation functions from.

%%Finite size effects
\section{Finite size effects}
\label{sec:N}
All the following figures are for $N = 26^2, 50^2$ and $100^2$ at $s=10^7$. They show densities $\phi = 0.800, 0.710$ and $0.700$.

\caption{Phonon dispersion for three systems at $\phi = 0.8$. The simulation data are essentially identical, and the theoretical curves vary by about 2\%. The $N=100^2$ curve has the advantage of having finer resolution in k-space, but the $N=26^2$ curve takes far less time to run. The theoretical curves show striking systematic error for large values of $k_y$, and I don't quite understand why. This suggests that, at this density, more is going on at short length scales than just nearest neighbor interactions.}

The takeaway from this comparison of finite size effects is that the $\bv k=0$ mode is sensitive to the number of particles in the system and the distance from the critical point. Small simulations are deceptive

\caption{Libron dispersion for $N=100^2$ and $s=10^7$ and for $\phi$ decreasing from $0.800$ to $0.680$. As the density is lowered through the crystal$\goto$hexatic transition and closer to the hexatic$\goto$ fluid transition, the libron's dispersion becomes flatter for $k>0$ and the $\bv k = 0$ mode continues to move towards 0. Once $\w(\bv k = 0) = 0$, this signifies a density at which the libron mode is no longer massive and a uniform rotation of the hexagons no longer costs energy (or rather entropy). The lower densities are provided in zoom in Figure \ref{phi8}}

Near phase transitions, the phonon and libron spectra can become flat. I'd like to explore and explain what that signifies. The potential energy part of the Hamiltonian expressed in terms of the Fourier components of the libron field $\tilde \th_{\bv k}$ (I'll just use the libron field for simplicity, and without loss of generality, because the librons and phonons are uncoupled at these densities anyway) is
\beq \mathcal{H} = \half{1} \sum_{\bv k} \tilde \th^*_{\bv k} K_{\th\th,\bv k} \tilde \th_{\bv k}. \eeq
Now, if we consider that the matrix $K_{\th\th,\bv k}$ is \emph{totally independent} of the wavevector $\bv k$, which is the case if the dispersion curve is \emph{totally flat}, then we can pull it out of the sum and perform the inverse Fourier transform:
\beq \mathcal{H} = \half{1} K_{\th\th} \sum_{\bv k} \tilde \th^*_{\bv k} \tilde \th_{\bv k} = \recip{2N}K_{\th\th} \sum_{\bv k} \sum_{\bv r_i} \sum_{\bv r_j} \th_i \th_j e^{i \bv k \cdot (\bv r_i - \bv r_j)}.\eeq
The orthogonality of the exponentials means that $\sum_{\bv k} e^{i \bv k \cdot (\bv r_i - \bv r_j)} = N\d_{ij}$, which then gives us back the real space Hamiltonian:
\beq \mathcal{H} = \half{1} K_{\th\th} \sum_i \th_i^2. \eeq
This is a set of uncoupled harmonic oscillators with spring constant $K_{\th\th}$, and if we use the generalized equipartition theorem (Eq. \ref{gen_equipartition}), we see that
\beq \avg{\th_i \th_j} = \frac{k_BT}{K_{\th\th}} \d_{ij}.\eeq
No orientational degree of freedom is correlated with any other degree of freedom. Yet, they still appear in the Hamiltonian and cost energy, evidently. This isn't exactly the right way to think about it. The fact that $K_{\th\th,\bv k= 0}\goto 0$ should be important. If we let $K_{\th\th,\bv k=0} = 0$ strictly, then we'll have an uninvertible matrix, so let's let it go to $\e K_{\th\th}$ to see what happens. So let's put that in:
\beq \mathcal{H} = \half{1}K_{\th\th} \sum_{\bv k \neq 0} \tilde \th^*_{\bv k} \tilde \th_{\bv k} + \half{1}K_{\th\th}\e = \half{1}K_{\th\th} \sum_{\bv k} \tilde \th^*_{\bv k} \tilde \th_{\bv k} - \half{1}K_{\th\th}(1-\e) \tilde \th^*_{0} \tilde \th_{0}. \eeq
Performing the inverse Fourier transform:
\beq \mathcal{H} = \half{1}K_{\th\th} \sum_{i} \th_i^2 - \recip{2N} K_{\th\th}(1-\e) \sum_{i,j} \th_i \th_j. \eeq
\beq \mathcal{H} = \recip{2N} K_{\th\th} \bm \th \cdot \pmtrx{N-1+\e & -1+\e & -1+\e & -1+\e & \ldots \\ -1+\e & N-1+\e & -1+\e & -1+\e & -1+\e \\ -1+\e & -1+\e & N-1+\e & -1+\e & -1+\e \\ -1+\e & -1+\e & -1+\e & N-1+\e & -1+\e \\ \vdots & -1+\e & -1+\e & -1+\e & \ddots} \cdot \bm \th = \half{1} \th_i K'_{ij} \th_j \eeq
Mathematica gives us the unintuitive result that the inverse of this matrix (which is proportional to the correlation function matrix of all the orientational degrees of freedom) is
\beq K'^{-1}_{ij} =  \recip{\e NK_{\th\th}} \pmtrx{ 1+(N-1)\e & 1- \e & 1 - \e & \ldots \\ 1 - \e &  1 + (N-1)\e & 1-\e  & 1-\e \\ 1 - \e & 1- \e & 1 + (N-1)\e & 1-\e \\ \vdots & 1-\e & 1-\e & \ddots }. \eeq
At this point I'd like to pause to interpret these results. The determinant of the matrix $\bv K'(\e)$ is $\mathcal{O}(\e)$. What this tells us is that if we let $\e\goto 0$ exactly, $\bv K'$ will no longer have an inverse and correlation functions will no longer be finite. The $\bv k = 0$ mode is \emph{floppy}. However, if we examine the components of $K'_{ij}$, all the off-diagonal components are nonzero and of order $1/N$, whereas the diagonal components are of order $1$. There is \emph{nonzero coupling to every particle in the system} but there is \emph{no cost to rotating all the particles the same amount}. That is, we can send every $\th_i \goto \th_i + \Delta \th$ and it wouldn't cost any energy. However, \emph{every particle is weakly coupled to every other particle}, and by weakly, it is meant that the coupling between $\th_i$ and $\th_j$ is order $1/N$ (but there are $\sim N$ degrees of freedom that $\th_i$ is coupled to, so it is weakly coupled to the whole system by $\mathcal{O}(1)$ interactions). The way I am interpreting this is that this represents an ideal gas that is coupled in a mean-field manner to itself, just like the infinite-range Ising model.
%To make this more explicit, we can expand the Hamiltonian for $\e=0$ (I computed this for $N=3$ and verified that it generalized in Mathematica):
%\beq \mathcal{H} = \half{1}\th_i K'_{ij} \th_j = \frac{K_{\th\th}}{2N} \sum_{i>j} \paren{\th_i - \th_j}^2. \eeq
%Let's see how the Hamiltonian changes if we rotate all the particles by a small (formally differential) amount $\d\th_i$ (not necessarily the same for all the particles):
%\[ \mathcal{H}' = \paren{\th_i + \d\th_i} K'_{ij} \paren{\th_j+\d\th_j}.\]
%\[ \d\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}'-\mathcal{H} = 2\d\th_i K'_{ij} \th_j + \mathcal{O}(\d\th^2).\]
